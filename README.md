NekoChat Reloaded is an unofficial desktop client for NekoChat. It is for people who want a Windows XP-style chat application instead of using NekoChat in a browser tab.

## What the client includes

- Rooms and direct messages.
- Detached chat windows and voice calls.
- Windows XP-inspired themes, frames, icons, wallpapers, and controls.
- XP-style notification, login, call, and system sounds.

Visual assets are in [`assets/images`](assets/images), sounds are in [`assets/sounds`](assets/sounds), and themes are in [`themes`](themes) and [`prebuilt`](prebuilt).

> This is a custom client, not the official NekoChat application.
